# 1. returns: 1 (The element being deleted.)
#    The value of arr will be the product of the two arrays with the first element of just ["b"]
# 2. returns: [1, 2, 3] (element being deleted)
#    value of arr: [["b"], ["a", [1, 2, 3]]] 

#   I was surprised by this second one. This took some playing around before I had a good guess.
